How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
A design skill that I’ve developed during this course is building complex objects out of simple shapes. An example of this is building the pencil. Rather than just having a single cylinder for the pencil I had a cylinder as the main body of the pencil, a tapered cylinder as the tip, a short cylinder for the eraser and an elongated box for the pocket clip.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
The main process I used was to break the project up into parts to work on. For example I worked on each object individually.  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think I will use the strategy of breaking projects up in to manageable pieces in most if not all future projects.
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? 
One of the biggest strategies I used in this project is using coding patterns. After creating the first object and understanding how to render objects I was able to take that pattern and apply it to each additional object.
How did iteration factor into your development?
After each object I created I got a better understanding of how to create new objects.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I relied much more heavily on developing iteratively throughout this course. The first object I created was very difficult but with each object the process became much more easy.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course was a great introduction and I understand a lot better how much work it takes to create computer graphics. I may decide to learn more about computer graphics in the future.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I don’t plan on pursuing a career in computer graphics but this course has helped develop my problem solving skills.
